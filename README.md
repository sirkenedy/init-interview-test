To help us assess your level of skill and experience more effectively, we would like you to create a test project. This test project will help us better understand how you think, process requirements, and implement features. As a Mid-Level Developer, this task can be completed in less than a day.


Your client, SuperFreighters,  runs a freight-forwarding business, helping people move items like cars and equipment from the US and UK to Nigeria by air and by sea.


Three things affect the cost of the service

- Mode of Transport
- Weight of Item
- Country of Origin

For the sake of simplicity, let's set some values.

Every mode of transport has a base fare.
Base Fare by Air - 50,000 Naira
Base Fare by Sea - 15,000 Naira

By Air, everything arrives in Nigeria two days after shipment :). Transportation by Sea however, takes 10 times longer than by Air.

Weight of the item affects cost. Per Kilogram
By Air  - NGN 10,000
By Sea  - NGN 2,000
All packages are rounded up to kilograms.

Country of Origin
There's Flat Rate in each country for All Outgoing Packages
US - NGN 1,500
UK - NGN 800

Lastly, see if you can apply a 10% customs tax on the shipping cost as well.

Create an ordering system anyone can access for placing an order to ship a described item.

Based on the information they enter, calculate and display the amount their shipment will cost and allow payment for that order using Paystack or other real payment gateway. Use in test mode, no live payments.

However, an email should be sent to an admin and the customer about the order. No need to create a signup or login for customers in this test. That is all. We strongly recommend that you use the Laravel Framework.

What is important is how you approach doing this, much more than how it looks.  Use a free bootstrap-based theme.

Create a  private repository on bitbucket/GitHub and provide all your files (and SQL dump of the database with sample data) there so we can run and test. If you can host it somewhere and share the url, even better.

This task can be completed in less than a day. This timeline is based on the role you have applied for and the level of experience you indicated on your profile. However, to ensure you have enough time, you have 72 hours to turn in your submission by email.
